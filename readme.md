## dweet-laravel

Just playing around with the Laravel framework and cloning Dweet.io.

### Todo:

1. Get all dweets for a thing. get/dweets/for/{name}
3. Make sure "thing" is unique. 
4. Add route to deal with posted Json.

### Done:

1. Disable Sessions.
2. Random naming: https://gist.github.com/afriggeri/1266756
3. Persistance of dweets for 86400.
4. Get the last dweet for a thing. get/latest/dweet/for/{name}
5. Allow them to set the "thing" name.
